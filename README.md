# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the failure to properly handle promise rejections in asynchronous middleware or routes.

The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js server with an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) that might throw an error.  The current implementation lacks error handling, resulting in a silent failure.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with appropriate error handling using a `try...catch` block within the asynchronous operation or a `.catch` handler on the promise chain.  This ensures that errors are properly caught and handled, preventing unexpected application behavior.

## How to reproduce the bug:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Observe that the server starts but may not respond correctly or even crash without helpful error messages.

## How to fix the bug:

Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the corrected implementation. The key is to add comprehensive error handling mechanisms within your asynchronous operations, particularly in middleware and routes.
